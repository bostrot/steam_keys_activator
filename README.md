# Steam Keys Activator
A JS script to activate multiple Steam keys automatically in your browser.

## Edit
Before you start with the usage, copy the code from activator.js into a text editor. There you will need to add your keys in the JS array format: [ "key1", "key2", "key3" ] You can find more about this in the file itself.

## Usage
1. Go to the Steam register key site (https://store.steampowered.com/account/registerkey).
1. Open the developer console. (In Chrome F12; If you are not using Chrome look it up with Google)
1. Go to the Console tab
1. Paste the code with your keys
1. Press enter
1. Let it do

## Important
* This is a REALLY simply script that helped me out a lot.
* It will take about 10 seconds for the first key and than 10 seconds for every other key.
* You can use your PC in background but don't close the tab where it is running.

## TODO:
* Error Handling
* Bookmarklet
* Asynchronous task
